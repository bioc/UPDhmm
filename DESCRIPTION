Description: 
  Uniparental disomy (UPD) is a genetic condition
  where an individual inherits both copies 
  of a chromosome or part of it from one parent, 
  rather than one copy from each parent. This package 
  contains a HMM for detecting UPDs throguh HTS 
  (High Throughput Sequencing) data from trio assays. 
  By analizing the genotypes in the trio, the model
  infers a hidden state (normal, father isodisomy, 
  mother isodisomy, father heterodisomy and mother heterodisomy).
